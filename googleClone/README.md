This google clone web helped me enhanced my knowledge regarding centering a div and element using 3 ways:
<br>
```
1. adding text align to the body element
    text-align: center;
2. using display block

    display: block;
    width: set width;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;

3. using flex

    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
```

I also learned about display: inline; which puts two elements beside each other.
