This webpage is created for my 1st SOLO Project in this course. <br>
This test my centering elements  and div skills

This focuses mainly on the CSS part of the web.
<br> To achieve this look, I implented, 
```
display: block; //and
display: flex;
```

margin, padding, and width, played crucial role in this!<br>
*the p's width is adopted from the img width
