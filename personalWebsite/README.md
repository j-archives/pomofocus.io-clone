# Personal Website
![personal-website](https://github.com/j-archives/Learn-HTML-CSS/blob/main/web%20screenshots/personal-website.png)

NOTE: This website is not my first personal website but, It is my first doing a personal website from an Online Course. 
<br> The lesson discussed here is purely HTML without CSS. I only added styling since I already know about it and wanted to practice my CSS Skills

This covers:
- Core HTML tags
- Nesting (ul/ol -> li)
- Buttons
- Input field:
  <br>type = text, email, password, radio, submit, etc
- Anchor tags
- Document Structure
- Lists
